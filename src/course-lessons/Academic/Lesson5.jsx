<h1>Lesson Five (5): MLA Formatting Style - 8th Edition </h1>

<p>MLA (Modern Language Association) style, is used to write papers and cite sources within the liberal arts and humanities.</p>

            <h3>First page</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In MLA, there has to be a writer’s surname and a page number in the right upper corner of each page. This header has to be flush right.</li>
            <li>There is no title page in MLA. The paper begins with a section on the left which contains information about the student’s name, the professor’s name, the course number, and the date of the paper. Do not violate this order!</li>
            <li>This section should be flush left, double-spaced.</li>
            <li>Begin the title of the paper from the next line.</li>
            <li>It has to be centered, not underlined, not italicized, not placed in quotation marks (unless you refer to other works in your title such as books, articles, films etc.).</li>
            <li>The Title Case has to be used for the title.</li> <br />

            <img src="/images/MLA/firstpage.png" alt="" /> <br /><br />
            Note: Sometimes the clients may require a single spacing. Then you should follow their requirements. 
            Or they may request for a title page. In such situation, they should provide you with clarifications on how the title page should look like. If not, ask for them. <br />
            You will have a chance to learn the terms of proper communication between you and clients in our later lessons.
        </ul>

        <h3>In-text citations</h3>
        <ul>

        In-text citations in MLA contain information about the author of the work and the page number with no comma between them. <br />
        As a rule, in-text citations are put at the end of the idea paraphrased: <br />
        Example: <i>In Africa, beating the heat is largely done by using the most traditional means of shade and water (James 150).</i> <br />

        Note: The period is put after the in-text citation. <br /> <br />

        If while paraphrasing the idea the author’s name is mentioned in the text, only the page number is included into parenthesis which is located at the end of the idea paraphrased. <br />
        Example: <i>According to James, in Africa, beating the heat is largely done by using the most traditional means of shade and water (150).</i> <br /><br />


        Use block quotes when quotations are longer than four typed lines. <br />
        Block quotes begin on a new line, are double spaced, and are indented 1” from the margin. Do not use quotation marks.The citation information (either the author name and the page number or just the page number) follows the punctuation mark which is at the end of the quotation. <br />
        Example: <i>James’s research founded the following: 
        In Africa, beating the heat is largely done by using the most traditional means of shade and water. 
        Shade comes mostly from trees - Johannesburg is known for having the largest man-made forest in the world with over 10 million trees planted across the city of gold. It is these trees that come in handy when it is very hot. People simply sit under the trees in the shade. 
        Water is another way of cooling down on a hot summer's day. In South Africa people tend to spend time in swimming pools either at home or in publicly run pools. 
        There are also the ice lollies sold at traffic lights. (150)</i> <br /><br />



        When a print source has a corporate author, one may use the name of the corporation followed by the page number for the in-text citation. <br />
        When the author of the work is unknown, one should use a shortened title of the work instead of an author’s name. The title should be placed in quotation marks if it's a short work (e.g. an article) or italicized if it's a longer work (e.g. plays, books, television shows). Besides, the page number is to be provided. <br />
        Example: <i>(“Annual Marathon” 45).</i> <br /><br />

        Note: The full name of the article should appear first at the left-hand margin of its respective entry in the Works Cited. <br />
        Example: <i>“Annual Marathon.” Sport Today. 2014, http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00lmvvy.Accessed 4 May 2009.</i> <br />br

        To cite multiple sources in the same parenthetical reference, separate the citations by a semicolon <br /> 
        Example: <i>...as has been discussed elsewhere (James 3; Dewey 21).</i> <br /><br />

        If you are citing non-print sources without page numbers available, include in the first item that appears in the Work Cited entry that corresponds to the citation 
        (e.g. author’s name, article name, website name, film name) either to the text (then no parenthesis is needed at all) or to the parenthesis. <br />
        Example: <i>During the presentation, Jane Yates stated that invention and pre-writing are areas of rhetoric that need more attention.</i> <br />
        <center>OR</center> <br />
        Example: <i>In the presentation it was stated that invention and pre-writing are areas of rhetoric that need more attention (Yates).</i> <br /><br />

        The respective entry on the Works Cited page is the following: <br /> 
        <i>Yates, Jane. "Invention in Rhetoric and Composition." Gaps Addressed: Future Work in Rhetoric and Composition, CCCC, Palmer House Hilton, 2002. Presentation.</i>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reference to sources </h3>
        <ul>
        In MLA, unlike APA, both in the text of the paper and in the Works Cited, title case is used to refer to some particular sources. <br />
        Examples: <br />
        <b>In the text</b>: A Darkness More Than Night <br />
        <b>In the Works Cited</b>: Connelly, Michael. A Darkness More than Night. Little Brown and Company, 2001. <br /><br />
        
        But as well as in the APA, longer works are usually italicized, whereas parts of works are put in quotation marks.
        </ul>

        <h3>Reference to Author(s)</h3>
        <ul>
        If two or more authors have the same last name, provide both authors' first initials. <br />
        Example: <i>Whereas some specialists suggest beating the heat using shade and water (R. James 150), others are for some more radical means (P. James 78).</i> <br /><br />

        In MLA, unlike APA, there is no difference whether the reference to the author(s) is made for the first or for the second time. 
        Neither is any difference between the reference to the author(s) in the text of the paper and the parenthesis: <br />
        <img src="/images/MLA/ref-aut.PNG" alt="" />
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Headings</h3>

        <ul>
        As was mentioned, we will stick to the numeric system of headings for all formatting styles (1st, 2nd, 3rd…). <br />

        Unlike APA, there are no strict rules at to how each level heading should be formatted. 
        Therefore, we have chosen the following system of headings in MLA each writer should stick to unless not followed by particular instructions of the client: <br />


        <h5>MLA headings</h5>
        <li><b>1st level: Bold, Flush Left, Title Case</b>The paragraph should start from a new line, also flush left.</li>
        <li><b>2nd level:</b><i>Italics, Flush Left, Title Case.</i>The text should begin just after the period.</li>
        <li><b>3rd level: Centered, Bold, Title Case.</b>The paragraph should start from a new line, flush left.</li>
        <li><b>4th level:</b><i>Centered, Italics, Title Case.</i>The paragraph should start from a new line, flush left.</li>
        <li><b>5 level:</b><u>Underlined, Flush Left, Title Case.</u>The paragraph should start from a new line, also flush left.</li> <br />
        <img src="/images/MLA/levels.png" alt="" />
        <img src="/images/MLA/levels(1).png" alt="" />

        </ul>

        <h3>Works Cited</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The list of sources used in the paper should appear at the end of the paper.</li>
            <li>It should begin on a new page separate from the text of the essay.</li>
            <li>It should be labelled ‘Works Cited’ (both words should start with a capital letter; if only one source is used, you may use ‘Work Cited’ in singular).</li>
            <li>The words ‘Works Cited’ should be centered at the top of the page (NOT bolded, not underlined, not italicized, not in quotation marks).</li>
            <li>Double space all citations, but do not skip spaces between entries.</li>
            <li>Indent the second and subsequent lines of citations by 0.5 inches to create a hanging indent.</li>
            <li>Sources should be arranged in the alphabetical order by the the author's last name. Authors' names are written last name first; middle names or middle initials follow the first name. Unlike in APA, please, try to provide full names instead of initials.</li>
            <li>If the author of the work is unknown, alphabetize it by its title but together with all other sources.</li> <br />

            <img src="/images/MLA/works_cited.png" alt="" /> <br />

            <u>A print book with one author:</u> <br />
            Jacobs, Alan. <i>The Pleasures of Reading in an Age of Distraction.</i> Oxford UP, 2011. <br /><br />

            Only the most essential information is included (author’s name, book title, publisher, and date). Note that the city of publication is not needed, and the medium of publication is eliminated. <br /><br />

            <u>An article from a scholarly journal:</u> <br />
            Kincaid, Jamaica. “In History.” <i>Callaloo</i>, vol. 24, no. 2, Spring 2001, pp. 620-26. <br /><br />

            This version identifies the volume (24), the number (2), and the page numbers (620-26) of the scholarly journal. Also note that punctuation is simple; only commas separate the journal title, volume, number, date, and page numbers. <br /><br />

            <u>Online Sources:</u> <br />
            Bernstein, Mark. "10 Tips on Writing the Living Web." <i>A List Apart: For People Who Make Websites</i>, 16 Aug. 2002, alistapart.com/article/writeliving. Accessed 4 May 2009. <br /><br />

            For online sources, you should include a location to show readers where you found the source. Many scholarly databases use a DOI (digital object identifier). Use a DOI in your citation if you can; otherwise use a URL. Delete “http://” from URLs. The DOI or URL is usually the last element in a citation and should be followed by a period. <br />
            All works cited entries end with a period. <br /> <br />

            MLA also uses the phrase, “Accessed on” to denote which date you accessed the web page when available or necessary. <br /> <br />

            <u>A YouTube Video</u> <br />
            With the Eighth edition you may now cite YouTube. <br /> <br />

            Video and audio sources need to be documented using the same basic guidelines for citing print sources in MLA style. Include as much descriptive information as necessary to help readers understand the type and nature of the source you are citing. If the author’s name is the same as the uploader, only cite the author once. 
            If the author is different from the uploaded, cite the author’s name before the title. <br /><br />

            “8 Hot Dog Gadgets put to the Test.” <i>YouTube</i>, uploaded by Crazy Russian Hacker, 6 Jun. 2016, www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBlpjSEtELs. <br /><br />
            McGonigal, Jane. “Gaming and Productivity.” YouTube, uploaded by Big Think, 3 July 2012, www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkdzy9bWW3E. <br /> <br />

            <li>You do not have to put ‘Print’ for print sources according to the 8th edition of the MLA guide.</li>
            <li>Instead of Web for online sources, use Accessed on.</li>
            <li>You should use a DOI in your citation if you can; otherwise use a URL.</li>
            <li>Delete “http://” from URLs. The DOI or URL is usually the last element in a Citation and should be followed by a period.</li> <br />
            <img src="/images/MLA/works-cited.png" alt="" /> <br />

            Remember that the titles of books and periodicals are italicized in the Works Cited as a rule. <br />
            The articles or the chapters are not italicized. Use quotation marks for them. <br />
            Unlike in APA, the title case should be used for all sources. So, capitalize each word except articles (the, a, an), prepositions, or conjunctions unless one is the first word of the title or subtitle. <br />
            Let’s sum up how different types of sources should be formatted in MLA in the text of the paper and in Works Cited. <br />
            <img src="/images/MLA/works-cited(1).PNG" alt="" />

        </ul>

        <h3>Summing Up…</h3>
        <ul>
        <b>Double spacing</b> is used throughout the whole paper. <br />
        There is <b>no title page</b> as a rule. <br />
        There is a section on the left of <b>the first page</b> with the student’s name, the professor’s name, the course number, and the date of the paper. <br />
        <b>In-text citations</b> usually contain information about the author of the work and the page number with no comma between them. <br />
        <b>The headings</b> are levelled. <br />
        The words <b>‘Works Cited’</b> are used for the list of sources. <br />

        </ul>
