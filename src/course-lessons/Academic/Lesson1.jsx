    <h1>Lesson One (1): Introduction to Academic Writing  </h1>


    
     
        <h2><i>What is academic writing?</i></h2>
        <p> 
            Academic writing is a specific writing style that is commonly employed in academic and scholarly settings.
            It serves the purpose of presenting research findings, discussing scholarly ideas, and contributing to the existing body of knowledge in a particular field. <br />
             This form of writing deals with homework from students all across the world who due to their busy schedules, cannot put up with their homework. 
             Most of our students (clients) are from the U.S. and the UK, therefore the work we produce must be of a high standards and adhere to international writing standards.
            <br/>Many youths, both students and recent graduates, have tapped in academic writing as a side gig. 
            It provides the chance to make a good living, depending on one's hard work and perseverance.
            Many successful writers have built homes and bought cars from this job. I am sure that is what has motivated you to join our training program.
            
        </p>

        <h2>The scope of writing</h2>
        <p>While most of you have handled class assignments with ease, foreign schools have specified writing formats for each subject. 
            These include APA, MLA, HARVARD, CHICAGO, TURBIAN, e.t.c. Basically, the formats dictate how a paper should be presented, 
            dealing with issues like formatting, citations, paragraphing, indentation, and heading, among other elements. 
            However, these are rather straightforward guidelines that should not scare you, we will provide enough education materials to perfect your understanding. 
        </p>

        <br/><br/>
        <p>You can earn as much as 40$ in a day, under an employer, and more than 100$ when working with your own account depending on your effort.
            But as a newbie you should not be frustrated if you don't make that much.</p> <br/><br/>

        <h5>Below are some take-away tips to get you started</h5>

        <p>

            1. Do not pressure yourself, writing competence is a long-life skill, gained from practising and training relentlessly.<br/>
            2. It will take time for you to acquire the speed and accuracy of experienced writers; hence, you should not feel discouraged by managing a single page in a day. <br/>
            3. After some time in writing you can buy or create your own account, leading to more income and flexibility.<br/>
            4. Academic writing is a real full-time job for many people today, consider the benefit to a student or a graduate.<br/>
            5. For students, continued writing prepares you for the final school project and thesis prompts.<br/>
            6. This job will enable you to save and prepare for life after school, transitioning into the outside world is a real challenge.<br/>
            7. Most importantly, you will never borrow money from friends or family ever again, it's all in your effort.<br/>
          

        <br/><br/><span></span>
         In this course we will cover the <span>general rules of academic writing</span>, the <span>structure and types of academic papers</span>, and the different <span>referencing formats</span> with <span>assignments</span> after each section to gauge your progress.  <br/>
        We will also introduce you to real <span>jobs</span> (different from the assignments), guide you on how to <span>create the different types of accounts</span>  and finally how to <span>deal with your clients</span> when you start working.
        </p>

 

  
    <h2>General rules of academic writing</h2>

    <p>
    <h3>
       1. Avoid awkwardness in your writing.
    </h3>
    
    Awkwardness in writing is a tendency to make your writing confusing and uncomfortable to read. 
    Such awkward sentence or a paper makes the reader guess what exactly did the writer mean, which breaks the integrity of reading and the impression your writing makes. 
    In order to avoid that, the writer should be aware of the following concepts:
    
    <h4> A. Parallelism</h4>

    
    Parallelism means expressing similar parts of a sentence in a consistent way. In other words, the elements that are similar in their function should be alike in construction too.
    <br/>
    <i>Wrong: She likes cooking, jogging, and to read. / She wants to learn English, to work hard, and becoming a good writer.</i>
    <br/><br/>
    As you can see, the grammatical units in these sentences are not balanced. This makes the sentences sound awkward. Properly balancing parts of your sentence into a well-organized parallel construction improves readability and flow of your sentences.
    <br/>
    <i>Right: She likes cooking, jogging, and reading. / She wants to learn English, to work hard, and to become a good writer.</i>
    
    <br/>

    <h4> B. Mixed construction</h4>

    
     When a sentence has mixed construction, the subject of the sentence does not match the verb or the verb does not match the object.
    <br/>
    <i>Wrong: A person taking on the role of a caregiver is a very demanding job.</i>
    <br/><br/>
    Narrowing the sentence down to its core shows that something is wrong with the logic. The core of the sentence says, “A person is a job,” which is nonsense.
    <br/>
    <i>Right: A person taking on the role of caregiver has a very demanding job.</i>
    <br/><br/>
    As you can see, a simple change of the verb is enough to fix the awkward construction.
    
    <br/>


    <h4> C. Nominalization</h4>
    
        Nominalization is a transformation of a verb or adjective into a noun. While such forms are acceptable in general, the sentence reads much easier and looks clear if you avoid unnecessary nominalization.
    <br/>
    <i>Wrong: Attempts at explanations for increases in voter participation in this year’s elections were made by the scholars.</i>
    <br/><br/>
    <i>Right: The scholars attempted to explain why more voters participated in this year’s elections.</i>
    <br/>
    As you can see, when the verbs and adjectives are not used as nouns the sentence reads much better.
    
    <br/>

    <h4> D. Passive voice</h4>
    
        Passive voice is a construction in which the subject of the sentence does not actually “do” anything, but has something “done” to it. Passive voice often comes with nominalization since in both cases, the person who actually takes action, is not in the subject position. Let’s take a look at the same example from the previous section:
        <br/>
       <i> Wrong: Attempts at explanations for increases in voter participation in this year’s elections were made by the scholars.</i>
    <br/><br/>
    Place the doer in a subject position in order to correct the passive construction.
    <br/>
    <i>Right: The scholars attempted to explain why more voters participated in this year’s elections.</i>
    
    <br/>

    <h4> E. Wordiness</h4>

    
        Wordiness presumes more words than necessary to make a point. Usually wordy sentences are extremely redundant. 
        In such awkward constructions, it is quite easy to make a number of mistakes.
        <br/>
        This sentence comes directly from one of the essays we found during the general evaluation:
         <br/>“<i>Over the past one decade, social media has recorded unprecedented and has had an immense impact on the way people interact.</i>”
         <br/><br/>Do you like it? Neither do we. Definite writers believe it is a sign of a good style to use the largest polysyllabic words they can find; and that it is even better to use a lot of them. 
         However, good writing is not about using the big words; it is about using the best words. And, as we always suggest, use simple language.

         <br/><br/>
         We also recommend to avoid the following 5 phrases. These sentences come from the essays written by our writers. 
         You may want to paraphrase them, as they hardly meet the standards of professional writing: <br />
    
    
        <b>1. Be in a position to.</b>
        <br/>
        <i>I am not in a position to write this paper.</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Therefore, the company would be in a position to continue raising its revenues.</i>
        <br/><br/>

       <b>2. On how to.</b>
       <br/>
        <i>They offer their opinions and suggestions on how they expect the negotiations to end.</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Their insight on how oral readings influence the adaptation of ESL students.</i>

        <br/><br/>
        <b>3. Come up with.</b> Use formal terms (invent, create, devise.)
        <br/>
        <i>I have to come up with a time management plan for myself.</i>
        <br/>
        <i>They were able to come up with only two variables.</i>
        <br/><br/>

        <b>4.The same</b> (referring to a noun or a process you have mentioned earlier).
        <br/>
        <i>Since the declaration of surrogacy in India as legal in 2002 the business is tremendously thriving with commendable profits from the same.</i>
        <i>Independence should be attained to avoid a repeat of the same.</i>
        <br/><br/>

       <b>5. No longer the case. </b>Not a big deal, but there are more professional ways to say that.
       <br/>
        <i>The media informed the public that this was no longer the case.</i>
        <br/><br/>

    

    <h3>
        2. Use accurate and formal English.
     </h3>
    
        Academic writing is expected to maintain a formal tone throughout the text. 
        This means using objective language, avoiding slang or colloquial expressions, and presenting information in an impersonal manner. 
        The focus should be on the subject matter rather than personal opinions or emotions.
        <br/><br/>
        Take a look at the rules below and try to follow them in your writing. <br/>

    
    
        <b>*Anybody, anyone</b>: <br />
        <i>Anyone</i> and its variants are more formal than <i>anybody</i> and its variants.
        <br/>

        <b>*As</b>: <br />
         <i>As</i> is often used in formal writing to mean <i>because</i>. <br/>
        Placing a comma before “as” can help prevent ambiguity when it could also be understood to mean “when” or “where.”
        <br/>

        <b>*Big, large, great</b>: <br />
         All these words are acceptable in formal English, but <i>large</i> is more formal than <i>big</i>, and <i>"great"</i> is more formal than <i>"large"</i>.
         <br/>
         <b>*Fellow</b>: <br />
         Avoid using fellow when you mean a person. 
         Calling someone a <i>fellow</i> is more formal than calling him or her a dude, but fellow is still a colloquialism.
         <br/>

         <b>*For sure</b>: <br />
          Replace <i>"for sure"</i> with <i>"with certainty"</i>in formal writing.
         <br/>

         <b>*Get</b>: <br />
          Avoid all forms of this verb in formal writing: <br />
         “<i>I received an A in the course</i>.” vs.
          “<i>I got an A in the course</i>”; <br />
           “<i>She did not understand the joke</i>.” vs.
           “<i>She did not get the joke</i>.”; <br />
         “<i>The machine is never used</i>.” vs. 
          “<i>The machine never gets used</i>.”;
         <br/>
         <b>*Got</b>: <br />
         <i>Got</i> is a colloquialism. <br />
         Replace it with have, as in “<i>Do you have [not "got"] an extra pen?</i>" 
         <br/>

         <b>*Kind of, sort of</b>: <br />
          "<i>Kind of</i>" and  "<i>sort of</i>" are unacceptable in formal writing when used for "<i>somewhat</i>" and "<i>rather</i>." <br />
         When used to categorize something, "<i>kind of</i>" and "<i>sort of</i>" are acceptable, but "<i>type of</i>" is more formal:  “<i>Kestrel is a type of bird</i>." <br />
          Note that it is informal to include an article after "<i>of</i>": "<i>Kestrel is a type of a bird</i>."
          <br/>

          <b>*Let</b>: <br />
          When used in place of  "<i>allow</i>" or <i>"permit,"</i>  <i>"let"</i> is a colloquialism.
          <br/>

          <b>*Most</b>: <br />
          In formal English, do not use <i>"most"</i>  for<i>"almost."</i> <br />
           You should write, <i>"Almost everyone likes pizza,"</i> not <i>"Most everyone likes pizza."</i>
          <br/>

          <b>*On the other hand</b>: <br />
           "On the other hand" is a very common phrase, but can be considered a cliché and should, therefore, be avoided in extremely formal English. <br />
            Instead, use <i>"conversely"</i> or <i>"by contrast."</i> <br />
          <i>"On the other hand"</i> is particularly useful in everyday writing and can eliminate the temptation to start with <i>"but."</i>
          <br/>

          <b>*So</b>: <br />
          Avoid using <i>"so"</i> as a synonym for <i>"very"</i> in extremely formal writing. <br />
          In perfectly formal writing, you also should avoid using <i>"so"</i>  as a coordinating conjunction. <br />
          You can eliminate this colloquialism by deleting <i>"so"</i>  and beginning the sentence with <i>"because."</i> <br /> 
          Compare <i>"The song may bother me, so I will cover my ears"</i>  and <br /> <i>"Because the song may bother me, I shall cover my ears."</i>  <br />
          Sometimes, you need the conjunction <i>"that"</i>  after <i>"so,"</i> as in <br /> <i>"I wrote this how-to so that you could improve your grammar and style."</i> 
          <br/>

          <b>*-ly</b>: <br />
          Usually, the words ending <i>"-ly"</i> are more formal. <br />For example, <i>"firstly"</i> is more formal than <i>"first."</i>
